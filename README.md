Rockfall! is a basic HTML5/Javascript game in which one must avoid the falling rocks until the timer runs out. It serves as an HTML5 practice program for a larger game to be made after playing with some of the new HTML5 features.


To run the game, simply grab the files and open index.html in a browser capable of rendering HTML5 content. It's available here:
